# You should now have access to the `vehicles` data frame
# You can use `View()` to inspect it
# Select the different manufacturers (makes) of the cars in this data set.
# Save this vector in a variable
# Use the `unique()` function to determine how many different car manufacturers
# are represented by the data set
# Filter the data set for vehicles manufactured in 1997
# Arrange the 1997 cars by highway (`hwy`) gas milage
# Hint: use the `order()` function to get a vector of indices in order by value

# Mutate the 1997 cars data frame to add a column `average` that has the average
# gas milage (between city and highway mpg) for each car
# Filter the whole vehicles data set for 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more
# than 20 miles/gallon in the city.
# Save this new data frame in a variable.
# Of the above vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst
# hwy mpg?
# Hint: filter for the worst vehicle, then select its ID.
# Write a function that takes a `year_choice` and a `make_choice` as parameters,
# and returns the vehicle model that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles
# of that make in that year.
# You'll need to filter more (and do some selecting)!
