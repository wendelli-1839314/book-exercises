# Exercise 1: creating and accessing lists
# Create a vector `my_breakfast` of everything you ate for breakfast
# Create a vector `my_lunch` of everything you ate (or will eat) for lunch
# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch
# Add a "dinner" element to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat
# for dinner
# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner < meals$dinner
print(dinner)
# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason beyond practice)
meals[[5]] <- [["lunch"]]
print(meals)
# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early_meals`
early_meals <- meal[c("breakfast","lunch")]
print(early_meals)
### Challenge ###
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function to apply the `length()` function to each item
length(meals$breakfast)
length(meals$lunch)
length(meals$dinner)
num_items <- lapply(meals, length)
print(num_items)
# Write a function `add_pizza` that adds pizza to a given meal vector, and
# returns the pizza-fied vector
add_pizza <- function(meal_vector) {
new_vector <- c(meal_vector, "pizza")
return(new_vector)
}
add_pizza(c("nachos"))
# Create a vector `better_meals` that is all your meals, but with pizza!
lapply(meals, add_pizza)
